    <p>Every journey begins with a first step, and understanding motion starts with knowing where you are. Position, displacement, and distance are the foundation of describing how objects move through space. Whether you're tracking a car on a highway, a runner on a track, or a satellite in orbit, these concepts help us precisely describe where objects are and how far they've traveled.</p>

<!-- ============== INTRODUCTION ============== -->
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Imagine you're giving directions to a friend. You might say "drive 5 miles north," or "walk 3 blocks east and then 2 blocks south." Without realizing it, you're using the language of physics to describe motion. But physicists need to be very precise about how they describe where things are and how far they've moved.</p>

<p>In our everyday lives, we constantly track our position and measure how far we've traveled. Your phone's GPS tells you your exact location. A car's odometer measures the total distance you've driven. A delivery truck driver needs to know both where packages need to go and the best route to get there. All of these situations require understanding the difference between where you are, how far you've moved, and the path you took to get there.</p>

<p>In this section, we'll explore three fundamental concepts that form the foundation for understanding motion: position, displacement, and distance. While these words might seem similar in everyday conversation, in physics each has a specific meaning that helps us describe motion with mathematical precision.</p>

<!-- ============== MAIN CONTENT ============== -->
<h1>Coordinate Systems and Position</h1>

<p>Before we can describe where something is, we need a reference point. In physics, we use a <span class="vocab-term">coordinate system</span> to specify the location of objects. For motion along a straight line (one-dimensional motion), we use a number line with a chosen origin (zero point) and a chosen positive direction.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Position</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Position</span> is the location of an object relative to a chosen reference point (origin). Position is represented by the symbol $x$ and is measured in meters (m). Position can be positive or negative depending on which side of the origin the object is located.</p>
</div>

<p>Think of position like an address on a street. If you choose a particular house as your origin (position zero), then houses on one side of the street might have positive addresses (+1, +2, +3) while houses on the other side have negative addresses (-1, -2, -3). The number tells you how far from the origin, and the sign (+ or -) tells you which direction.</p>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h3>Real-World Example: Football Field</h3>
    <p>On a football field, the 50-yard line is often used as the origin. If a team is at their own 30-yard line, we might say they're at position -20 yards (20 yards to the left of midfield). If they're at the opponent's 40-yard line, they're at position +10 yards (10 yards to the right of midfield). The position tells you exactly where the team is on the field.</p>
</div>

<h2>Displacement</h2>

<p>While position tells us where an object is, <span class="vocab-term">displacement</span> tells us how far and in what direction an object has moved from its starting position.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Displacement</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Displacement</span> is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (size) and direction. Displacement is represented by the symbol $\Delta x$ (read as "delta x") and is measured in meters (m).</p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$$</p>
    <p>where $x_f$ is the final position and $x_i$ is the initial position.</p>
</div>

<p>The Greek letter delta ($\Delta$) means "change in" and is used throughout physics to indicate the difference between a final value and an initial value. So $\Delta x$ literally means "the change in position."</p>

<p>Displacement can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive displacement means the object moved in the positive direction (forward, to the right, or upward in most coordinate systems). A negative displacement means the object moved in the negative direction (backward, to the left, or downward). A zero displacement means the object ended up exactly where it started.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Important Note</h3>
    <p>Displacement is a <span class="vocab-term">vector quantity</span>, which means direction matters. A displacement of +5 m is not the same as a displacement of -5 m, even though both represent moving 5 meters. The positive and negative signs indicate opposite directions.</p>
</div>

<h3>Example of Displacement</h3>
<p>Suppose a car starts at position $x_i = 10$ m and ends at position $x_f = 35$ m. The displacement is:</p>
<p>$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i = 35\text{ m} - 10\text{ m} = 25\text{ m}$$</p>
<p>The positive displacement tells us the car moved 25 meters in the positive direction.</p>

<p>Now suppose the car travels from $x_i = 40$ m back to $x_f = 15$ m. The displacement is:</p>
<p>$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i = 15\text{ m} - 40\text{ m} = -25\text{ m}$$</p>
<p>The negative displacement tells us the car moved 25 meters in the negative direction (backward).</p>

<h2>Distance</h2>

<p>Unlike displacement, which only depends on the starting and ending positions, <span class="vocab-term">distance</span> depends on the actual path traveled.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Distance</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Distance</span> is the total length of the path traveled by an object, regardless of direction. Distance is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. Distance is represented by the symbol $d$ and is measured in meters (m). Distance is always positive or zero, never negative.</p>
</div>

<p>Think of distance as the reading on a car's odometer. It doesn't matter if you drove north, south, or in circles—the odometer simply adds up all the miles you traveled. Distance cares about the path, not the direction.</p>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h3>Real-World Example: Walking Home</h3>
    <p>Imagine you walk from your house to school, which is 500 meters north of your home. Your displacement is 500 m north. But suppose you realize you forgot your homework and walk back home to get it, then walk to school again. You've walked a total distance of 1500 meters (500 m to school + 500 m back home + 500 m to school again), but your displacement is still only 500 m north because you ended up at school.</p>
</div>

<h2>Comparing Displacement and Distance</h2>

<p>The key difference between displacement and distance is that displacement is a <span class="vocab-term">vector</span> (has direction) while distance is a <span class="vocab-term">scalar</span> (no direction). Let's look at another example to make this clear.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Understanding Vectors vs. Scalars</h3>
    <p><strong>Vector quantities</strong> have both magnitude and direction. Examples include displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force. Vectors can be positive or negative in one dimension.</p>
    <p><strong>Scalar quantities</strong> have only magnitude, no direction. Examples include distance, speed, time, mass, and temperature. Scalars are always positive or zero.</p>
</div>

<p>Imagine a runner on a track. If the runner starts at one end of a 100-meter straight track, runs to the other end, and then runs back to the starting point, what are the distance and displacement?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Distance traveled:</strong> The runner covered 100 m forward plus 100 m back = 200 m total. Distance = 200 m.</li>
    <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> The runner ended where they started, so final position equals initial position. $\Delta x = 0$ m.</li>
</ul>

<p>This illustrates an important principle: <strong>distance is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of displacement</strong>. Distance equals displacement only when an object moves in a straight line without changing direction.</p>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h3>Historical Note: Measuring the Earth</h3>
    <p>The ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes (276-194 BCE) was one of the first people to accurately measure the Earth's circumference. He compared the position of the sun at noon in two different cities (Alexandria and Syene) that were on the same longitude line. By measuring the angle of the sun's rays and knowing the distance between the cities, he calculated the Earth's circumference to within 2% of the modern value—an amazing achievement using only simple geometry and careful position measurements!</p>

    <h3>Example 1: Calculating Displacement</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A bicycle rider starts at position $x_i = 12$ m and rides to position $x_f = 47$ m along a straight bike path. What is the rider's displacement?</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. List the Givens:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial position: $x_i = 12$ m</li>
        <li>Final position: $x_f = 47$ m</li>
        <li>Unknown: displacement $\Delta x$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>2. Find the Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Substitute:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = 47\text{ m} - 12\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Solve:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = 35\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Check:</strong></p>
    <p>The displacement is positive, which makes sense because the final position (47 m) is greater than the initial position (12 m), meaning the rider moved in the positive direction. The units are correct (meters).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The rider's displacement is 35 m in the positive direction.</span></p>

<div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example 2: Negative Displacement</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A car travels along a straight highway. It starts at position $x_i = 85$ m and ends at position $x_f = 32$ m. Calculate the displacement of the car.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. List the Givens:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial position: $x_i = 85$ m</li>
        <li>Final position: $x_f = 32$ m</li>

    <p>$$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Substitute:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = 32\text{ m} - 85\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Solve:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = -53\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Check:</strong></p>
    <p>The displacement is negative, which makes sense because the final position (32 m) is less than the initial position (85 m), meaning the car moved backward or in the negative direction. The magnitude is 53 m, and the negative sign indicates direction.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The car's displacement is -53 m (or 53 m in the negative direction).</span></p>

    <h3>Example 3: Distance vs. Displacement</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A delivery truck leaves the warehouse at position $x = 0$ m, drives to position $x = 40$ m to make a delivery, then drives to position $x = 15$ m to make a second delivery. Calculate both the total distance traveled and the truck's displacement.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. List the Givens:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting position: $x_1 = 0$ m</li>
        <li>First stop: $x_2 = 40$ m</li>
        <li>Second stop (final): $x_3 = 15$ m</li>
        <li>Unknown: total distance $d$ and displacement $\Delta x$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>2. Find the Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>For displacement: $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$</p>
    <p>For distance: $d_{total} = d_1 + d_2$</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Substitute and Solve for Displacement:</strong></p>
    <p>The initial position is $x_i = 0$ m and the final position is $x_f = 15$ m.</p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = 15\text{ m} - 0\text{ m} = 15\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Calculate Distance for Each Segment:</strong></p>
    <p>First segment (warehouse to first delivery):</p>
    <p>$$d_1 = |x_2 - x_1| = |40\text{ m} - 0\text{ m}| = 40\text{ m}$$</p>
    <p>Second segment (first delivery to second delivery):</p>
    <p>$$d_2 = |x_3 - x_2| = |15\text{ m} - 40\text{ m}| = |-25\text{ m}| = 25\text{ m}$$</p>
    <p>Total distance:</p>
    <p>$$d_{total} = d_1 + d_2 = 40\text{ m} + 25\text{ m} = 65\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Check:</strong></p>
    <p>The displacement (15 m) is less than the total distance (65 m), which makes sense because the truck changed direction during its trip. The truck ended 15 m from the warehouse in the positive direction, but it traveled a total of 65 m along its path.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The truck's displacement is 15 m. The total distance traveled is 65 m.</span></p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
    <li>A <strong>coordinate system</strong> with an origin and positive direction is needed to describe position in one dimension.</li>
    <li><strong>Position</strong> ($x$) is the location of an object relative to a chosen origin, measured in meters.</li>
    <li><strong>Displacement</strong> ($\Delta x$) is the change in position, calculated as $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$. It is a vector quantity with magnitude and direction.</li>
    <li>Displacement can be positive (motion in positive direction), negative (motion in negative direction), or zero (object returns to starting point).</li>
    <li><strong>Distance</strong> ($d$) is the total length of the path traveled, regardless of direction. It is a scalar quantity with magnitude only.</li>
    <li>Distance is always positive or zero and is greater than or equal to the magnitude of displacement.</li>
    <li>Distance equals displacement magnitude only when an object moves in a straight line without reversing direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Vector quantities</strong> (like displacement) have both magnitude and direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalar quantities</strong> (like distance) have only magnitude, no direction.</li>
    <li>The Greek letter delta ($\Delta$) means "change in" and appears frequently in physics formulas.</li>

<h1>Answer Key</h1>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Position</strong> is the location of an object relative to an origin at a particular moment in time. <strong>Displacement</strong> is the change in position, showing how far and in what direction an object has moved from its starting point. Example: Two cars start at different positions ($x_1 = 10$ m and $x_2 = 30$ m) but both drive 20 m forward. Their final positions are different ($x_1' = 30$ m and $x_2' = 50$ m), but they both have the same displacement of +20 m.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> The student has described <strong>distance</strong>. Distance is the total path length traveled and doesn't include direction. To describe displacement, the student would need to specify a direction, such as "I walked 3 kilometers north."</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Yes</strong>, it is possible. This occurs whenever an object returns to its starting position after moving. For example, if you walk around a circular track and return to where you started, your displacement is zero (you ended where you began), but the distance is the circumference of the track (the total path length you walked).</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>a) <strong>Position:</strong> Vector (in one dimension, position can be positive or negative, indicating direction from origin)</li>
    <li>b) <strong>Distance:</strong> Scalar (distance is always positive and has no direction)</li>
    <li>c) <strong>Displacement:</strong> Vector (displacement includes both magnitude and direction)</li>
    <li>d) <strong>Temperature:</strong> Scalar (temperature has magnitude but no direction)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Givens:</strong> $x_i = 25$ m, $x_f = 78$ m</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$</p>
<p><strong>Substitute:</strong> $\Delta x = 78\text{ m} - 25\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> $\Delta x = 53\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The runner's displacement is 53 m in the positive direction.</span></p>

<p><strong>6.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Givens:</strong> $x_i = 92$ m, $x_f = 47$ m</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$</p>
<p><strong>Substitute:</strong> $\Delta x = 47\text{ m} - 92\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> $\Delta x = -45\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The car's displacement is -45 m. The negative sign indicates that the car moved in the negative direction (backward or to the left if positive is to the right).</span></p>

<p><strong>7.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a) Total distance:</strong></p>
<p>Segment 1 (camp to lake): $d_1 = |4.5 - 0| = 4.5$ km</p>

<p>Segment 3 (viewpoint to camp): $d_3 = |0 - 2.0| = 2.0$ km</p>
<p>$d_{total} = 4.5 + 2.5 + 2.0 = 9.0$ km</p>
<p><strong>b) Displacement:</strong></p>
<p>$x_i = 0$ km, $x_f = 0$ km (returns to camp)</p>
<p>$\Delta x = 0 - 0 = 0$ km</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">a) Total distance = 9.0 km. b) Displacement = 0 km (the hiker returned to the starting point).</span></p>

<p><strong>8.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a) Displacement:</strong></p>
<p>$x_i = 150$ m (initial position), $x_f = 380$ m (final position)</p>
<p>$\Delta x = x_f - x_i = 380 - 150 = 230$ m</p>
<p><strong>b) Total distance:</strong></p>
<p>Segment 1: $d_1 = |420 - 150| = 270$ m</p>
<p>Segment 2: $d_2 = |550 - 420| = 130$ m</p>
<p>Segment 3: $d_3 = |380 - 550| = 170$ m</p>
<p>$d_{total} = 270 + 130 + 170 = 570$ m</p>
