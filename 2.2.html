    <p>How fast are you going? This simple question is actually asking about velocity—one of the most important concepts in physics. Velocity tells us not just how quickly something moves, but also which direction it's heading. From cars on highways to electrons in circuits, understanding velocity helps us describe and predict motion throughout the universe.</p>

</div>

<!-- ============== INTRODUCTION ============== -->
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When you check your car's speedometer, you're seeing a measurement of velocity. When a weather report says "winds from the north at 15 miles per hour," that's describing velocity. When a baseball announcer says "the pitcher threw a 95 mph fastball," they're talking about velocity (though without mentioning direction). Velocity is everywhere in our daily lives.</p>

<p>But what exactly is velocity? At its most basic level, velocity tells us the rate at which position changes. In other words, velocity measures how quickly something is moving and in what direction. A high velocity means rapid motion; a low velocity means slow motion; zero velocity means no motion at all.</p>

<p>In this section, we'll explore two related concepts: speed and velocity. While these words are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation, physicists make a crucial distinction between them. Understanding this difference will help you describe motion with precision and accuracy.</p>

<!-- ============== MAIN CONTENT ============== -->
<h1>Average Velocity</h1>

<p>In Section 2.1, we learned that displacement tells us how far and in what direction an object has moved. But displacement alone doesn't tell us how quickly that motion occurred. To describe the rate of motion, we need to know not just the displacement, but also the time interval during which the displacement occurred.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Average Velocity</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Average velocity</span> is the displacement divided by the time interval during which the displacement occurred. It is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction. Average velocity is represented by the symbol $v_{avg}$ or $\bar{v}$ and is measured in meters per second (m/s).</p>
    <p>$$v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_f - x_i}{t_f - t_i}$$</p>
    <p>where $\Delta x$ is displacement, $\Delta t$ is the time interval, $x_f$ and $x_i$ are final and initial positions, and $t_f$ and $t_i$ are final and initial times.</p>
</div>

<p>The formula for average velocity shows that velocity is the ratio of displacement to time. If an object has a large displacement in a short time, it has a high velocity. If an object has a small displacement over a long time, it has a low velocity.</p>

<p>Since displacement is a vector (it has direction), average velocity is also a vector. The direction of the velocity is the same as the direction of the displacement. A positive velocity indicates motion in the positive direction; a negative velocity indicates motion in the negative direction.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Units of Velocity</h3>
    <p>The SI unit of velocity is meters per second (m/s). However, you'll encounter many other units in everyday life:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>kilometers per hour (km/h) - common for cars</li>
        <li>miles per hour (mph) - common in the United States</li>
        <li>feet per second (ft/s) - sometimes used in engineering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Always pay attention to units and convert if necessary to keep all quantities in the same unit system.</p>
</div>

<h3>Understanding Average Velocity</h3>
<p>The word "average" is important here. Average velocity tells us the overall rate of displacement, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happened during the motion. An object might speed up, slow down, stop, or reverse direction—average velocity only captures the net result over the entire time interval.</p>

<p>For example, if you drive from home to school in 10 minutes, your average velocity is your displacement (from home to school) divided by 10 minutes. It doesn't matter if you stopped at red lights, waited in traffic, or drove at varying speeds—the average velocity only depends on where you started, where you ended, and how long it took.</p>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h3>Real-World Example: Marathon Running</h3>
    <p>A marathon is 42.195 kilometers long. If a runner completes the marathon in 3 hours, their average velocity is approximately 14.1 km/h (about 8.7 mph) along the course. Notice that we say "along the course"—the direction matters. If the marathon course loops back to the starting point (which many do), the displacement is zero and therefore the average velocity is zero, even though the runner clearly moved!</p>
</div>

<h2>Average Speed</h2>

<p>While average velocity is based on displacement (a vector), we can also calculate an average rate based on distance (a scalar). This gives us average speed.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Average Speed</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Average speed</span> is the total distance traveled divided by the time interval. It is a scalar quantity with magnitude only (no direction). Average speed is represented by the symbol $s_{avg}$ and is measured in meters per second (m/s).</p>
    <p>$$s_{avg} = \frac{d}{\Delta t}$$</p>
    <p>where $d$ is the total distance traveled and $\Delta t$ is the time interval.</p>
</div>

<p>The key difference between average velocity and average speed is that velocity uses displacement while speed uses distance. Remember from Section 2.1 that displacement and distance are not always the same—distance is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of displacement.</p>

<p>Average speed is always positive or zero (never negative) because distance is always positive or zero. In contrast, average velocity can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the direction of displacement.</p>

<h3>Comparing Average Velocity and Average Speed</h3>
<p>Let's compare these two quantities with a concrete example. Suppose you drive 60 km north in 1 hour, then turn around and drive 20 km south in 0.5 hours.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Total distance:</strong> 60 km + 20 km = 80 km</li>
    <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> 60 km north - 20 km south = 40 km north (or +40 km if north is positive)</li>
    <li><strong>Total time:</strong> 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours</li>
    <li><strong>Average speed:</strong> $s_{avg} = \frac{80\text{ km}}{1.5\text{ h}} = 53.3$ km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Average velocity:</strong> $v_{avg} = \frac{40\text{ km north}}{1.5\text{ h}} = 26.7$ km/h north</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that the average speed (53.3 km/h) is greater than the magnitude of the average velocity (26.7 km/h). This will always be true when an object changes direction during its motion.</p>

<h2>Instantaneous Velocity</h2>

<p>Average velocity tells us about motion over a time interval, but what if we want to know how fast something is moving at a particular instant? This is where instantaneous velocity comes in.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Instantaneous Velocity</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Instantaneous velocity</span> is the velocity of an object at a specific instant in time. It is the limit of average velocity as the time interval approaches zero. Instantaneous velocity is represented by the symbol $v$ (without the "avg" subscript) and is measured in meters per second (m/s).</p>
</div>

<p>Think of instantaneous velocity as the velocity shown on a car's speedometer at a particular moment. When you glance at your speedometer and it shows 60 mph, that's your instantaneous speed at that moment. (Speedometers show speed, not velocity, because they don't indicate direction.)</p>

<p>Mathematically, instantaneous velocity is what you get if you make the time interval $\Delta t$ extremely small—approaching zero. If we calculate average velocity over smaller and smaller time intervals, we get closer and closer to the instantaneous velocity at a particular moment.</p>

<p>For most situations in this course, when we refer to "velocity" without specifying average or instantaneous, we usually mean instantaneous velocity. The speedometer reading, the velocity of a ball at the moment it leaves your hand, and the velocity of a runner as they cross the finish line are all examples of instantaneous velocity.</p>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h3>Historical Note: Galileo and Motion</h3>
    <p>The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was one of the first to carefully study motion and distinguish between distance, speed, and acceleration. Before Galileo, many philosophers (following Aristotle) believed that heavier objects fell faster than lighter ones. Galileo challenged this through careful experiments and mathematical analysis. His work laid the foundation for Newton's laws of motion and our modern understanding of mechanics. Galileo showed that understanding motion requires precise definitions and mathematical descriptions—exactly what we're learning in this section!</p>

<h2>Sign Conventions for Velocity</h2>

<p>Because velocity is a vector, its sign indicates direction. The sign convention depends on how we've defined our coordinate system, but typically:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Positive velocity</strong> (+v): Motion in the positive direction (often right, forward, or upward)</li>
    <li><strong>Negative velocity</strong> (-v): Motion in the negative direction (often left, backward, or downward)</li>
    <li><strong>Zero velocity</strong> (v = 0): No motion (object is at rest)</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Important Distinction</h3>
    <p>A negative velocity does NOT mean the object is slowing down! It simply means the object is moving in the negative direction. An object with velocity -30 m/s is moving just as fast as an object with velocity +30 m/s—they're just moving in opposite directions.</p>

    </ol>
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example 1: Calculating Average Velocity</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A cyclist rides from position $x_i = 15$ m to position $x_f = 95$ m along a straight path. The ride takes 8.0 seconds. Calculate the cyclist's average velocity.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. List the Givens:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial position: $x_i = 15$ m</li>
        <li>Final position: $x_f = 95$ m</li>
        <li>Time interval: $\Delta t = 8.0$ s</li>
        <li>Unknown: average velocity $v_{avg}$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>2. Find the Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>$$v_{avg} = \frac{x_f - x_i}{\Delta t}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Substitute:</strong></p>
    <p>$$v_{avg} = \frac{95\text{ m} - 15\text{ m}}{8.0\text{ s}}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Solve:</strong></p>
    <p>$$v_{avg} = \frac{80\text{ m}}{8.0\text{ s}} = 10\text{ m/s}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Check:</strong></p>
    <p>The velocity is positive, which makes sense because the final position (95 m) is greater than the initial position (15 m), indicating motion in the positive direction. The units m/s are correct for velocity. The magnitude (10 m/s) seems reasonable for a cyclist.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The cyclist's average velocity is 10 m/s in the positive direction.</span></p>

<div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example 2: Average Speed vs. Average Velocity</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A jogger runs 400 m north in 80 seconds, then runs 150 m south in 30 seconds. Calculate both the jogger's average speed and average velocity for the entire run.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. List the Givens:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>First segment: 400 m north, 80 s</li>

    <p><strong>3 & 4. Calculate Total Distance and Time:</strong></p>
    <p>Total distance: $d = 400\text{ m} + 150\text{ m} = 550\text{ m}$</p>
    <p>Total time: $\Delta t = 80\text{ s} + 30\text{ s} = 110\text{ s}$</p>
    <p>Displacement (taking north as positive): $\Delta x = 400\text{ m} - 150\text{ m} = 250\text{ m}$</p>
    
    <p><strong>Average Speed:</strong></p>
    <p>$$s_{avg} = \frac{550\text{ m}}{110\text{ s}} = 5.0\text{ m/s}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>Average Velocity:</strong></p>
    <p>$$v_{avg} = \frac{250\text{ m}}{110\text{ s}} = 2.3\text{ m/s}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Check:</strong></p>
    <p>Average speed (5.0 m/s) is greater than the magnitude of average velocity (2.3 m/s), which makes sense because the jogger changed direction. Average velocity is positive, indicating net motion in the north (positive) direction. Both answers have appropriate units.</p>

    <h3>Example 3: Finding Displacement from Velocity</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A car travels with an average velocity of -18 m/s for 12 seconds. The car's initial position is $x_i = 200$ m. Find: (a) the car's displacement, and (b) the car's final position.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. List the Givens:</strong></p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Part (a): Find Displacement</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Find the Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>Rearranging $v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ gives us $\Delta x = v_{avg} \cdot \Delta t$</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Substitute:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = (-18\text{ m/s})(12\text{ s})$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Solve:</strong></p>
    <p>$$\Delta x = -216\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>Part (b): Find Final Position</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Find the Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>From $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$, we can rearrange to get $x_f = x_i + \Delta x$</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Substitute:</strong></p>
    <p>$$x_f = 200\text{ m} + (-216\text{ m})$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Solve:</strong></p>
    <p>$$x_f = -16\text{ m}$$</p>
    
    <p><strong>5. Check:</strong></p>
    <p>The negative displacement (-216 m) makes sense because the velocity was negative, meaning motion in the negative direction. The final position (-16 m) is less than the initial position (200 m), which is consistent with negative displacement. The car crossed the origin and ended up on the negative side.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">(a) Displacement = -216 m (or 216 m in the negative direction). (b) Final position = -16 m.</span></p>

<h1>Answer Key</h1>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Average velocity</strong> is displacement divided by time and includes direction (vector), while <strong>average speed</strong> is distance divided by time and has no direction (scalar). They are equal in magnitude only when an object moves in a straight line in one direction without reversing course. In this case, displacement equals distance, so $|v_{avg}| = s_{avg}$.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> The statement is <strong>incorrect</strong>. A velocity of -15 m/s means the object is moving at 15 m/s in the negative direction. The negative sign indicates direction, not slowness. An object with velocity -15 m/s is moving just as fast as an object with velocity +15 m/s—they're just moving in opposite directions.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>No</strong> to both. If velocity is zero, the object is at rest, so its speed must also be zero. If speed is zero, the object is at rest, so its velocity must also be zero. Speed is the magnitude of velocity, so they're both zero or both non-zero together. (Note: Instantaneous velocity and speed are always either both zero or both non-zero. Average velocity can be zero when average speed is not, such as when you return to your starting point.)</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Givens:</strong> $x_i = 5$ m, $x_f = -3$ m, $\Delta t = 4$ s</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> $v_{avg} = \frac{x_f - x_i}{\Delta t}$</p>
<p><strong>Substitute:</strong> $v_{avg} = \frac{-3\text{ m} - 5\text{ m}}{4\text{ s}} = \frac{-8\text{ m}}{4\text{ s}}$</p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> $v_{avg} = -2\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The average velocity is -2 m/s. The negative sign indicates motion in the negative direction (from positive position toward and past the origin).</span></p>

<p><strong>5.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For a complete lap on a circular track, the displacement is zero</strong> (the runner returns to the starting point).</p>
<p><strong>Average speed:</strong> $s_{avg} = \frac{d}{\Delta t} = \frac{400\text{ m}}{80\text{ s}} = 5.0\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>Average velocity:</strong> $v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{0\text{ m}}{80\text{ s}} = 0\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">Average speed = 5.0 m/s. Average velocity = 0 m/s (because displacement is zero).</span></p>

<p><strong>6.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Givens:</strong> $v_{avg} = 25$ m/s, $\Delta t = 6.0$ s, $x_i = 50$ m</p>
<p><strong>Find displacement first:</strong> $\Delta x = v_{avg} \cdot \Delta t = (25\text{ m/s})(6.0\text{ s}) = 150\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Find final position:</strong> $x_f = x_i + \Delta x = 50\text{ m} + 150\text{ m} = 200\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The car's final position is 200 m.</span></p>

<p><strong>7.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Convert time:</strong> 10 min = 600 s, 8 min = 480 s, total time = 1080 s</p>
<p><strong>Total distance:</strong> $d = 8.0\text{ km} + 5.0\text{ km} = 13.0\text{ km} = 13,000\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Displacement (east is positive):</strong> $\Delta x = 8.0\text{ km} - 5.0\text{ km} = 3.0\text{ km} = 3000\text{ m}$ east</p>
<p><strong>a) Average speed:</strong> $s_{avg} = \frac{13,000\text{ m}}{1080\text{ s}} = 12\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>b) Average velocity:</strong> $v_{avg} = \frac{3000\text{ m east}}{1080\text{ s}} = 2.8\text{ m/s east}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">a) Average speed = 12 m/s. b) Average velocity = 2.8 m/s east.</span></p>

<p><strong>8.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total distance:</strong> $d = 50\text{ m} + 50\text{ m} = 100\text{ m}$</p>
<p><strong>Total time:</strong> $\Delta t = 35\text{ s} + 38\text{ s} = 73\text{ s}$</p>
<p><strong>Displacement:</strong> $\Delta x = 0$ m (returns to start)</p>
<p><strong>a) Average speed (entire swim):</strong> $s_{avg} = \frac{100\text{ m}}{73\text{ s}} = 1.4\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>b) Average velocity (entire swim):</strong> $v_{avg} = \frac{0\text{ m}}{73\text{ s}} = 0\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>c) Average speed (return trip only):</strong> $s_{avg} = \frac{50\text{ m}}{38\text{ s}} = 1.3\text{ m/s}$</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">a) 1.4 m/s, b) 0 m/s, c) 1.3 m/s</span></p>
