    <p>Waves exhibit fascinating behaviors when they encounter boundaries, pass through openings, or meet other waves. Reflection bounces waves back, refraction bends their path, diffraction spreads them around obstacles, and interference creates patterns of reinforcement and cancellation. Understanding these wave behaviors explains everything from echoes to rainbows, from noise-cancelling headphones to the colors in soap bubbles.</p>

<!-- ============== INTRODUCTION ============== -->
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Have you ever shouted in a canyon and heard your voice echo back, or noticed how a pencil looks bent when partially submerged in water? These everyday observations reveal fundamental wave behaviors. Waves don't simply travel in straight lines—they interact with their environment in predictable and often spectacular ways.</p>

<p>When waves encounter obstacles, boundaries, or other waves, four key behaviors can occur: reflection (bouncing back), refraction (bending when entering a new medium), diffraction (spreading around obstacles), and interference (combining with other waves). These behaviors are not just scientific curiosities—they underlie technologies from ultrasound imaging to wireless communication, from concert hall acoustics to telescope design.</p>

<div class="historical-box">
    <h3>Historical Context: Young's Double-Slit Experiment</h3>
    <p>In 1801, Thomas Young performed one of the most important experiments in physics history. He passed light through two narrow, closely-spaced slits and observed an interference pattern of bright and dark bands on a screen. This pattern could only be explained if light behaved as a wave, with the two light waves from the slits interfering constructively (bright bands) and destructively (dark bands). This experiment settled a centuries-long debate about whether light was made of particles or waves (in favor of waves at the time), and demonstrated that light exhibits the same interference behavior as water waves and sound waves. Young's experiment revolutionized our understanding of light and established wave interference as a fundamental phenomenon.</p>
</div>

<p>This section builds on everything you've learned about waves in Sections 5.1-5.3. You understand that waves transfer energy, have characteristic properties like wavelength and frequency, and come in transverse and longitudinal forms. Now you'll discover what happens when these waves interact with the world around them—knowledge essential for understanding both natural phenomena and modern technology.</p>

<!-- ============== MAIN CONTENT ============== -->
<h1>Reflection of Waves</h1>

<p><span class="vocab-term">Reflection</span> occurs when a wave encounters a boundary or obstacle and bounces back into the original medium. You experience wave reflection every time you see your image in a mirror (light waves reflecting) or hear an echo (sound waves reflecting off a distant surface).</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Key Terms for Reflection</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Incident wave:</span> The wave approaching a boundary or surface.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Reflected wave:</span> The wave that bounces back from the boundary.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Normal line:</span> An imaginary line perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point where the wave hits.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Angle of incidence:</span> The angle between the incident wave and the normal line.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Angle of reflection:</span> The angle between the reflected wave and the normal line.</p>
</div>

<p>The fundamental principle governing reflection is the <span class="vocab-term">law of reflection</span>: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This law applies to all types of waves—light, sound, water waves, and more. When a wave hits a flat surface at a 30-degree angle from the perpendicular, it reflects at a 30-degree angle on the other side.</p>

<div class="formula-box">
    $$\theta_i = \theta_r$$
    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0.05in;">where $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection</p>
</div>

<p>The nature of reflection depends on whether the reflecting surface is smooth or rough. Smooth surfaces produce <span class="vocab-term">specular reflection</span> where parallel incoming waves reflect as parallel outgoing waves, creating clear images (like mirrors). Rough surfaces produce <span class="vocab-term">diffuse reflection</span> where waves scatter in many directions, preventing clear image formation but allowing us to see objects from various angles.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Real-World Application: Echoes and Echolocation</h3>
    <p>Echoes are reflected sound waves. When you shout toward a distant wall or cliff, sound waves travel to the surface, reflect, and return to your ears. Bats and dolphins use echolocation—they emit high-frequency sound waves and listen to the reflections to navigate and hunt in darkness or murky water. The time delay between emission and echo, combined with the speed of sound, tells them the distance to objects. This same principle is used in medical ultrasound and sonar technology.</p>
</div>

<h2>Refraction of Waves</h2>

<p><span class="vocab-term">Refraction</span> is the bending of waves as they pass from one medium into another where their speed changes. When light passes from air into water, or sound moves from cold air into warm air, the waves change direction at the boundary.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Understanding Refraction</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Refraction:</span> The bending of a wave's path as it enters a medium where it travels at a different speed.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Index of refraction (n):</span> A measure of how much a medium slows down light compared to its speed in vacuum; $n = c/v$ where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $v$ is the speed in the medium.</p>
</div>

<p>Refraction occurs because different parts of a wave front enter the new medium at different times. If a wave enters a slower medium at an angle, the part that enters first slows down while the rest is still traveling at the original speed. This causes the wave to bend toward the normal (perpendicular) line. Conversely, when a wave enters a faster medium, it bends away from the normal.</p>

<p>The relationship between angles and speeds in different media is described by <span class="vocab-term">Snell's Law</span>:</p>

<div class="formula-box">
    $$n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2$$
    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0.05in;">where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are indices of refraction, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are angles from the normal</p>
</div>

<p>Refraction explains many familiar phenomena. A pencil appears bent when placed in a glass of water because light rays from the submerged portion refract as they exit the water, making the pencil appear in a different location. Mirages in deserts occur because light refracts through layers of air at different temperatures. Lenses in eyeglasses, cameras, and telescopes work by carefully controlling refraction to focus light.</p>

<div class="historical-box">
    <h3>Real-World Example: Fiber Optic Cables</h3>
    <p>Modern internet and telecommunications rely on fiber optic cables, which use refraction to trap and guide light signals over long distances. These cables have a glass core with high refractive index surrounded by a cladding with lower refractive index. When light traveling through the core hits the boundary at a steep angle, it undergoes total internal reflection—it can't escape into the cladding and bounces back into the core. By repeatedly reflecting off the walls, light travels through the fiber even when the cable bends. This allows data to travel at nearly the speed of light with minimal loss over thousands of miles.</p>
</div>

<h2>Diffraction of Waves</h2>

<p><span class="vocab-term">Diffraction</span> is the spreading and bending of waves as they pass through openings or around obstacles. You've experienced diffraction if you've ever heard someone talking in the next room even though you can't see them—sound waves diffract around the doorway.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Diffraction Concepts</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Diffraction:</span> The bending and spreading of waves as they encounter edges, openings, or obstacles.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Diffraction pattern:</span> The characteristic distribution of wave intensity that results from diffraction, often showing alternating regions of high and low amplitude.</p>
</div>

<p>The amount of diffraction depends on the relationship between wavelength and the size of the opening or obstacle. When the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the obstacle/opening size, significant diffraction occurs. When the wavelength is much smaller than the obstacle/opening, diffraction is minimal and waves travel in relatively straight lines.</p>

<p>This explains why we can hear around corners but not see around them easily. Sound waves have wavelengths ranging from centimeters to meters, comparable to doorways and building corners, so they diffract significantly. Visible light has wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than most everyday objects, so it travels in straighter lines and diffraction is less noticeable in daily life.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Diffraction and Wave Size</h3>
    <p>Key principle: Significant diffraction occurs when wavelength ≈ opening size. Large diffraction: wavelength > opening. Small diffraction: wavelength << opening. This is why radio waves (long wavelength) easily diffract around buildings and through doorways, while light waves (short wavelength) do not. It's also why "bass" sounds (long wavelength) from a neighbor's music seem to come through walls more than high-pitched sounds (short wavelength).</p>
</div>

<p>Diffraction sets fundamental limits on the resolution of optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes. Larger apertures (openings) reduce diffraction effects and allow finer details to be resolved. This is one reason why astronomical telescopes have very large mirrors or lenses—to minimize diffraction and see finer details in distant objects.</p>

<h2>Interference of Waves</h2>

<p><span class="vocab-term">Interference</span> occurs when two or more waves occupy the same space at the same time. The waves combine according to the principle of superposition, and the resulting wave amplitude can be larger or smaller than the individual waves.</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <h3>Interference Vocabulary</h3>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Superposition:</span> When two or more waves overlap, the displacement at any point is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves at that point.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Constructive interference:</span> When waves combine to produce a larger amplitude; occurs when crests align with crests and troughs with troughs.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Destructive interference:</span> When waves combine to produce a smaller amplitude; occurs when crests align with troughs.</p>
    <p><span class="vocab-term">Phase:</span> The position within a wave cycle; waves "in phase" have aligned crests and troughs, while waves "out of phase" have misaligned features.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="vocab-term">Constructive interference</span> happens when two waves arrive at the same location with their crests and troughs aligned (in phase). The amplitudes add together, creating a wave with larger amplitude than either individual wave. If two identical waves with amplitude $A$ interfere constructively, the resulting amplitude is $2A$.</p>

<p><span class="vocab-term">Destructive interference</span> occurs when waves arrive with crests aligned with troughs (out of phase by 180 degrees or half a wavelength). The amplitudes subtract from each other. If two identical waves with amplitude $A$ interfere destructively, they can completely cancel, resulting in zero amplitude at that location.</p>

<div class="formula-box">
    <p><strong>Conditions for Interference:</strong></p>
    <p>Constructive: Path difference = $n\lambda$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3...$)</p>
    <p>Destructive: Path difference = $(n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3...$)</p>
</div>

<p>Interference creates distinctive patterns. In Young's double-slit experiment, light passing through two slits creates an interference pattern of bright and dark bands. Bright bands occur where waves from both slits arrive in phase (constructive interference), and dark bands occur where they arrive out of phase (destructive interference).</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Understanding Path Difference</h3>
    <p>Path difference is the difference in distance traveled by two waves to reach a common point. If one wave travels exactly one wavelength farther than another to reach a point, they arrive in phase and interfere constructively. If one wave travels exactly half a wavelength (λ/2) farther, they arrive out of phase and interfere destructively. This concept is crucial for understanding interference patterns.</p>
</div>

<h2>Standing Waves</h2>

<p>A special case of interference produces <span class="vocab-term">standing waves</span>. When a wave reflects back on itself—such as a wave on a guitar string reflecting from both fixed ends—the incident and reflected waves interfere to create a pattern that appears to stand still rather than propagate.</p>

<p>Standing waves have characteristic features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="vocab-term">Nodes:</span> Points of zero amplitude where destructive interference always occurs; particles at nodes don't move.</li>
    <li><span class="vocab-term">Antinodes:</span> Points of maximum amplitude where constructive interference occurs; particles at antinodes oscillate with maximum displacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Musical instruments rely on standing waves. A guitar string vibrates in standing wave patterns, with nodes at both ends (where the string is held fixed) and antinodes in between. Different musical notes correspond to different standing wave patterns—the fundamental frequency has one antinode in the middle, while higher harmonics have multiple antinodes.</p>

<div class="historical-box">
    <h3>Real-World Application: Noise-Cancelling Headphones</h3>
    <p>Noise-cancelling headphones use destructive interference to reduce unwanted sound. Microphones on the headphones detect incoming sound waves. The headphones then generate sound waves with the same frequency and amplitude but opposite phase (180 degrees out of phase). When these "anti-noise" waves combine with the environmental noise, destructive interference occurs, significantly reducing the sound you hear. This technology is particularly effective for constant low-frequency noise like airplane engines, train rumble, or air conditioning hum.</p>
</div>

<h2>Applications of Wave Behaviors</h2>

<p>Understanding wave behaviors has led to countless technologies and explains numerous natural phenomena:</p>

<p><strong>Architectural Acoustics:</strong> Concert halls use reflection to distribute sound evenly throughout the space. Carefully designed surfaces reflect sound waves so every audience member hears clearly without echoes or dead zones.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Imaging:</strong> Ultrasound uses reflection of sound waves from boundaries between different tissues to create images inside the body. Different tissues reflect ultrasound differently, allowing doctors to see organs, blood vessels, and developing babies.</p>

<p><strong>Optical Coatings:</strong> Anti-reflective coatings on eyeglasses and camera lenses use thin films that create destructive interference for reflected light, reducing glare and improving light transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Rainbow Formation:</strong> Rainbows form through refraction and reflection of sunlight in water droplets. Light refracts entering the droplet, reflects off the back surface, and refracts again while exiting. Different wavelengths (colors) refract by different amounts, separating white light into its spectrum.</p>

<!-- ============== EXAMPLE PROBLEMS ============== -->
<h1>Example Problems</h1>

<div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example 1: Reflection Angle Calculation</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A light ray strikes a flat mirror at an angle of 35° from the normal line. At what angle does the light reflect?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Angle of incidence: $\theta_i = 35°$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Find:</strong> Angle of reflection $\theta_r$</p>
    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>Use the law of reflection:</p>
    $$\theta_i = \theta_r$$
    
    <p>Therefore:</p>
    $$\theta_r = 35°$$
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The light reflects at 35° from the normal, on the opposite side of the normal from the incident ray.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    <h3>Example 2: Determining Interference Type</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Two identical sound waves with amplitude 0.50 mm meet at a point. One wave has traveled 3.0 m to reach this point, and the other has traveled 3.6 m. If the wavelength is 1.2 m, will the waves interfere constructively or destructively?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Amplitude of each wave: $A = 0.50 \text{ mm}$</li>
        <li>Distance traveled by wave 1: $d_1 = 3.0 \text{ m}$</li>
        <li>Distance traveled by wave 2: $d_2 = 3.6 \text{ m}$</li>
        <li>Wavelength: $\lambda = 1.2 \text{ m}$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Find:</strong> Type of interference and resulting amplitude</p>
    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>First, calculate the path difference:</p>
    $$\Delta d = d_2 - d_1 = 3.6 \text{ m} - 3.0 \text{ m} = 0.6 \text{ m}$$
    
    <p>Compare path difference to wavelength:</p>
    $$\frac{\Delta d}{\lambda} = \frac{0.6 \text{ m}}{1.2 \text{ m}} = 0.5 = \frac{1}{2}$$
    
    <p>Since the path difference is exactly half a wavelength ($\lambda/2$), the waves arrive out of phase and will interfere destructively.</p>
    
    <p>For complete destructive interference of identical waves:</p>
    $$A_{result} = 0 \text{ mm}$$
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">The waves interfere destructively. Since they have equal amplitudes and the path difference is exactly λ/2, they completely cancel, resulting in zero amplitude at this point.</span></p>

    <h3>Example 3: Multi-Step Wave Interference Analysis</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Two speakers are placed 4.0 m apart, both emitting sound waves with frequency 1,715 Hz. A listener stands 5.0 m from speaker A and 7.0 m from speaker B. The speed of sound is 343 m/s.</p>
    <p>(a) Calculate the wavelength of the sound.</p>
    <p>(b) Calculate the path difference between waves from the two speakers reaching the listener.</p>
    <p>(c) Will the listener hear constructive or destructive interference? Explain.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Speaker separation: 4.0 m</li>
        <li>Distance from speaker A: $d_A = 5.0 \text{ m}$</li>
        <li>Distance from speaker B: $d_B = 7.0 \text{ m}$</li>
        <li>Frequency: $f = 1,715 \text{ Hz}$</li>
        <li>Speed of sound: $v = 343 \text{ m/s}$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Find:</strong> (a) Wavelength, (b) Path difference, (c) Type of interference</p>
    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Part (a):</strong> Use the wave equation to find wavelength:</p>
    $$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{343 \text{ m/s}}{1,715 \text{ Hz}} = 0.20 \text{ m}$$
    
    <p><strong>Part (b):</strong> Calculate path difference:</p>
    $$\Delta d = d_B - d_A = 7.0 \text{ m} - 5.0 \text{ m} = 2.0 \text{ m}$$
    
    <p><strong>Part (c):</strong> Compare path difference to wavelength:</p>
    $$\frac{\Delta d}{\lambda} = \frac{2.0 \text{ m}}{0.20 \text{ m}} = 10$$
    
    <p>The path difference equals exactly 10 wavelengths, which is an integer multiple of λ. This means the waves arrive in phase and will interfere constructively. The listener will hear a louder sound at this location.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="highlight">(a) The wavelength is 0.20 m (20 cm). (b) The path difference is 2.0 m. (c) The listener experiences constructive interference because the path difference equals exactly 10 complete wavelengths, causing the waves to arrive in phase and reinforce each other, producing a loud sound.</span></p>

<div class="answer-space"></div>

<!-- ============== ANSWER KEY ============== -->
<div class="page-break"></div>
<h1>Answer Key</h1>

<p><strong>1.</strong> You can hear someone in the next room because of diffraction—sound waves spread around obstacles and through openings like doorways. Sound has much longer wavelengths (centimeters to meters) compared to doorway sizes, so significant diffraction occurs, allowing sound to bend around corners and spread into adjacent rooms. Light has extremely short wavelengths (hundreds of nanometers), much smaller than doorways, so it diffracts very little and travels in straighter lines. This is why sound easily reaches you around corners while light does not.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> During constructive interference, two waves arrive at a point with their crests and troughs aligned (in phase). According to the principle of superposition, the displacements add together. If two identical waves each have amplitude $A$, constructive interference produces a resulting amplitude of $2A$—twice as large as either individual wave. The waves reinforce each other, creating a stronger combined disturbance. This is heard as louder sound or seen as brighter light.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> This effect is caused by refraction—the bending of light waves as they pass from one medium (water) to another (air). Light travels at different speeds in water and air. When light from the submerged part of the pencil exits the water at an angle, it bends away from the normal (perpendicular) line because light travels faster in air than water. This bending causes the light rays to appear to come from a different location, making the pencil look bent or broken at the water's surface. The pencil itself is straight; it's the light path that bends.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> In a standing wave, nodes are points of zero amplitude where destructive interference always occurs—particles at nodes remain stationary. Antinodes are points of maximum amplitude where constructive interference occurs—particles at antinodes oscillate with the largest displacement. On a vibrating guitar string, the nodes are located at the fixed ends where the string is held (bridge and fret/nut), and possibly at intermediate points for higher harmonics. Antinodes occur at points between nodes, where the string moves with maximum displacement. For the fundamental frequency, there is one antinode in the middle of the string.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <span class="highlight">$\theta_r = 42°$</span></p>
<p>Solution: By the law of reflection, $\theta_i = \theta_r$</p>
<p>Therefore, the angle of reflection is 42° from the normal line.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> <span class="highlight">Destructive interference</span></p>
<p>Solution: Calculate path difference:</p>
$$\Delta d = 6.2 \text{ m} - 5.0 \text{ m} = 1.2 \text{ m}$$
<p>Compare to wavelength:</p>
$$\frac{\Delta d}{\lambda} = \frac{1.2 \text{ m}}{0.40 \text{ m}} = 3.0$$
<p>Wait, this gives 3, which is an integer, suggesting constructive interference. Let me recalculate:</p>
$$\frac{1.2}{0.40} = 3$$
<p>Actually, a path difference of 3λ means constructive interference. Let me reconsider the problem setup. Actually, if the calculation gives exactly 3.0, that's 3 complete wavelengths, which means <strong>constructive interference</strong>, not destructive. However, if we check: $1.2/0.40 = 3.0$ exactly, so this is constructive. But let me verify the problem numbers... The path difference is 1.2 m and wavelength is 0.40 m, so 1.2/0.4 = 3, which is an integer multiple, meaning <span class="highlight">constructive interference</span>.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> <span class="highlight">(a) $\lambda = 0.50 \text{ m}$, (b) Path difference = 2.5 m, (c) Destructive interference</span></p>
<p><strong>Part (a):</strong> Use $\lambda = v/f$:</p>
$$\lambda = \frac{343 \text{ m/s}}{686 \text{ Hz}} = 0.50 \text{ m}$$

<p><strong>Part (b):</strong> Path difference:</p>
$$\Delta d = 10.5 \text{ m} - 8.0 \text{ m} = 2.5 \text{ m}$$

<p><strong>Part (c):</strong> Compare path difference to wavelength:</p>
$$\frac{\Delta d}{\lambda} = \frac{2.5 \text{ m}}{0.50 \text{ m}} = 5.0$$
<p>Since 5.0 is an integer, this suggests constructive... but wait: $2.5/0.5 = 5$, which is an integer multiple of λ, so this would be <strong>constructive interference</strong>. The listener would hear a loud sound. Let me double-check: if $\Delta d = 5\lambda$, then the waves arrive in phase, so <span class="highlight">constructive interference</span> occurs. The listener hears a louder sound because the waves reinforce each other.</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> <span class="highlight">(a) 8.0 cm, constructive interference; (b) 0 cm, destructive interference; (c) Waves continue unchanged</span></p>
<p><strong>Part (a):</strong> When crests align (constructive interference):</p>
$$A_{result} = A_1 + A_2 = 4.0 \text{ cm} + 4.0 \text{ cm} = 8.0 \text{ cm}$$
<p>This is constructive interference, doubling the amplitude.</p>

<p><strong>Part (b):</strong> When a crest aligns with a trough (destructive interference):</p>
$$A_{result} = A_1 - A_2 = 4.0 \text{ cm} - 4.0 \text{ cm} = 0 \text{ cm}$$
<p>This is complete destructive interference, resulting in zero amplitude—the water surface is momentarily flat at that point.</p>

<p><strong>Part (c):</strong> After the waves pass through each other, each wave continues unchanged with its original amplitude and direction. Interference is a temporary effect that occurs only when and where waves overlap. The waves don't permanently affect each other—they pass through and emerge as if they never met. This is a fundamental property of wave behavior called the principle of superposition.</p>
