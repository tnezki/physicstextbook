<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In Sections 2.1 through 2.3, we developed the fundamental concepts of position, velocity, and acceleration. Now we're ready to put these concepts together into a powerful set of mathematical tools called the <span class="highlight">kinematic equations</span>. These equations allow us to predict the future position and velocity of any object moving with constant acceleration, making them essential for analyzing everything from car crashes to rocket launches to planetary motion.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important applications of kinematic equations is <span class="highlight">free fall</span>—the motion of objects under the influence of gravity alone. Galileo Galilei's revolutionary insight that all objects fall at the same rate (ignoring air resistance) contradicted centuries of Aristotelian physics and laid the groundwork for Newton's laws of motion. In this section, we'll explore both the mathematical framework of kinematic equations and their application to free fall.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the kinematic equations is that they form a complete, interconnected system. If you know any three of the five kinematic variables (initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, time, and displacement), you can find the other two. This makes them incredibly versatile tools for solving real-world physics problems.
</p>

<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<h2>The Four Kinematic Equations</h2>
<p>
For motion with <span class="highlight">constant acceleration</span>, there are four fundamental equations that relate position, velocity, acceleration, and time. These equations are derived from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, and together they provide a complete description of one-dimensional motion.
</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <strong>Kinematic Equations:</strong> A set of four equations that describe the motion of an object with constant acceleration. These equations relate displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time.
</div>

<p>
The four kinematic equations are:
</p>

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border: 2px solid #0066cc; border-radius: 5px;">
    <p><strong>Equation 1:</strong> $v_f = v_i + at$</p>
    <p><em>Relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time</em></p>
    <p><em>Missing variable: displacement ($\Delta x$)</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Equation 2:</strong> $\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$</p>
    <p><em>Relates displacement, initial velocity, acceleration, and time</em></p>
    <p><em>Missing variable: final velocity ($v_f$)</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Equation 3:</strong> $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$</p>
    <p><em>Relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and displacement</em></p>
    <p><em>Missing variable: time ($t$)</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Equation 4:</strong> $\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$</p>
    <p><em>Relates displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, and time</em></p>
    <p><em>Missing variable: acceleration ($a$)</em></p>
</div>

<p>
Where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>$v_f$ = final velocity (m/s)</li>
    <li>$v_i$ = initial velocity (m/s)</li>
    <li>$a$ = acceleration (m/s²)</li>
    <li>$t$ = time (s)</li>
    <li>$\Delta x$ = displacement (m)</li>
</ul>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> These equations ONLY apply when acceleration is constant! If acceleration changes during the motion, you must break the problem into segments where acceleration is constant in each segment.
</div>

<h3>Choosing the Right Equation</h3>
<p>
The key to solving kinematic problems is selecting the appropriate equation. Here's a systematic approach:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>List what you know:</strong> Write down the given values for $v_i$, $v_f$, $a$, $t$, and $\Delta x$</li>
    <li><strong>Identify what you need to find:</strong> Determine the unknown variable</li>
    <li><strong>Count your knowns:</strong> You need three known values to find a fourth</li>
    <li><strong>Choose the equation:</strong> Select the equation that contains your three knowns and the one unknown</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here's a helpful table for choosing equations:
</p>

<table>

        <th>If You Know...</th>
        <th>And Want to Find...</th>
        <th>Use This Equation</th>
    </tr>

<h2>Free Fall and Gravitational Acceleration</h2>
<p>
One of the most important applications of kinematic equations is <span class="highlight">free fall</span>—the motion of objects moving under the influence of gravity alone, with no other forces (like air resistance) acting on them.
</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <strong>Free Fall:</strong> The motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone. In free fall, the only acceleration is due to gravity, denoted by $g$.
</div>

<p>
Near Earth's surface, all objects in free fall experience the same acceleration due to gravity:
</p>

$$g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$$

<p>
This value is approximately constant for objects near Earth's surface and doesn't depend on the object's mass, composition, or size (as long as we neglect air resistance). This remarkable fact was first demonstrated convincingly by Galileo Galilei.
</p>

<h3>Sign Convention for Free Fall</h3>
<p>
When working with free fall problems, we must establish a sign convention:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>If UP is positive:</strong> $a = -9.8$ m/s² (acceleration points downward)</li>
    <li><strong>If DOWN is positive:</strong> $a = +9.8$ m/s² (acceleration points downward)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most physics courses use the convention that <strong>up is positive</strong>, which means $a = -g = -9.8$ m/s². Be consistent with your sign convention throughout each problem!
</p>

<h3>Galileo's Revolutionary Discovery</h3>
<div class="real-world-box">
    <h4>Historical Context: Galileo and Free Fall</h3>
    <p>
    For nearly 2,000 years, scientists believed Aristotle's claim that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) challenged this view through careful experimentation. Using inclined planes to "dilute" gravity's effect and make timing easier, Galileo discovered that all objects accelerate at the same rate when falling, regardless of their mass.
    </p>
    <p>
    According to legend, Galileo dropped two spheres of different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and observed that they hit the ground simultaneously (though this story is likely apocryphal). What we do know is that Galileo's work laid the foundation for Newton's laws of motion and our modern understanding of gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 1971, astronaut David Scott performed a memorable demonstration on the Moon, dropping a hammer and a feather simultaneously. Without air resistance, both objects hit the lunar surface at exactly the same time, beautifully confirming Galileo's insight.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Why Do All Objects Fall at the Same Rate?</h3>
<p>
This seems counterintuitive—surely a bowling ball should fall faster than a feather? The key insight is that while gravitational force on an object does depend on its mass, so does the object's resistance to acceleration (inertia). These two effects exactly cancel out:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A heavier object experiences more gravitational force</li>
    <li>But a heavier object also has more inertia (resistance to acceleration)</li>
    <li>The ratio of force to inertia is the same for all objects</li>
    <li>Therefore, all objects accelerate at the same rate: $g = 9.8$ m/s²</li>
</ul>

<p>
In everyday life, feathers fall more slowly than rocks because of air resistance, not because of different gravitational acceleration. In a vacuum (like on the Moon), they fall at the same rate.
</p>

<h3>Objects Thrown Upward</h3>
<p>
An important special case of free fall is an object thrown vertically upward. Throughout the entire flight—going up, at the peak, and coming down—the acceleration is <strong>constant</strong> at $a = -g = -9.8$ m/s² (using the up-is-positive convention).
</p>

<div class="vocab-box">
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> When an object is thrown upward, its acceleration is $-9.8$ m/s² throughout the entire motion—even at the highest point where the velocity is momentarily zero. The acceleration doesn't change; only the velocity changes!
</div>

<p>
Key characteristics of upward motion:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Going up: velocity is positive, acceleration is negative (object slows down)</li>
    <li>At the peak: velocity is zero, acceleration is still $-9.8$ m/s²</li>
    <li>Coming down: velocity is negative, acceleration is still $-9.8$ m/s² (object speeds up in downward direction)</li>
    <li>The time to go up equals the time to come down (for symmetric motion)</li>
    <li>The speed when returning to launch height equals the initial speed</li>
</ul>

<!-- REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS -->
<div class="real-world-box">
    <h4>Real-World Application: Skydiving</h3>
    <p>
    When a skydiver first jumps from a plane, they initially experience free fall acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s². However, as they speed up, air resistance increases. Eventually, air resistance equals the gravitational force, and the skydiver reaches "terminal velocity" (about 120 mph or 54 m/s for a human in spread-eagle position). At terminal velocity, acceleration becomes zero, and velocity remains constant. This is why skydivers can fall for extended periods without continuously accelerating—they're no longer in true free fall once air resistance becomes significant.
    </p>

<div class="real-world-box">
    <h4>Real-World Application: Reaction Time Testing</h3>
    <p>
    The "ruler drop test" uses free fall to measure reaction time. A person holds their fingers around (but not touching) the top of a ruler held vertically by another person. When the ruler is dropped without warning, the reaction time can be calculated from how far the ruler falls before being caught. Using $\Delta y = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$, if the ruler falls 20 cm (0.20 m), the reaction time is about 0.20 seconds. This simple test is used in driver education and sports training.

    <h4>Example 2.4.1: Simple Kinematic Equation Application</h3>
    <p>
    A car accelerates from rest at 3.0 m/s² for 8.0 seconds. What is the car's final velocity?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p><em>Step 1: Identify what you know and what you need to find</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial velocity: $v_i = 0$ m/s (starts from rest)</li>
        <li>Acceleration: $a = 3.0$ m/s²</li>
        <li>Time: $t = 8.0$ s</li>
        <li>Find: Final velocity $v_f$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Step 2: Choose the appropriate equation</em></p>
    <p>We have $v_i$, $a$, and $t$, and we want $v_f$. The displacement is not mentioned, so we use:</p>
    $$v_f = v_i + at$$
    
    <p><em>Step 3: Substitute the known values</em></p>
    $$v_f = 0 \text{ m/s} + (3.0 \text{ m/s}^2)(8.0 \text{ s})$$
    
    <p><em>Step 4: Calculate the result</em></p>
    $$v_f = 0 + 24 \text{ m/s}$$
    $$v_f = 24 \text{ m/s}$$
    
    <p><em>Step 5: Check your answer</em></p>
    <p>The car starts from rest and accelerates, so a positive final velocity makes sense. The units are correct. A velocity of 24 m/s (about 54 mph) after 8 seconds of acceleration at 3.0 m/s² is reasonable for a car.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Answer: The car's final velocity is 24 m/s</strong></p>

    <h4>Example 2.4.2: Free Fall Distance Calculation</h3>
    <p>
    A rock is dropped from rest from a bridge that is 45 meters above a river. How long does it take for the rock to hit the water? (Use $g = 9.8$ m/s²)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p><em>Step 1: Identify what you know and what you need to find</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial velocity: $v_i = 0$ m/s (dropped from rest)</li>
        <li>Displacement: $\Delta y = -45$ m (down is negative if up is positive)</li>
        <li>Acceleration: $a = -g = -9.8$ m/s² (down is negative)</li>
        <li>Find: Time $t$</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Step 2: Choose the appropriate equation</em></p>
    <p>We have $v_i$, $\Delta y$, and $a$, and we want $t$. We don't know $v_f$, so we use:</p>
    $$\Delta y = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
    
    <p><em>Step 3: Substitute the known values</em></p>
    $$-45 \text{ m} = (0 \text{ m/s})t + \frac{1}{2}(-9.8 \text{ m/s}^2)t^2$$
    $$-45 = 0 - 4.9t^2$$
    $$-45 = -4.9t^2$$
    
    <p><em>Step 4: Solve for time</em></p>
    $$t^2 = \frac{-45}{-4.9} = \frac{45}{4.9} = 9.18$$
    $$t = \sqrt{9.18} = 3.03 \text{ s}$$
    
    <p><em>Step 5: Check your answer</em></p>
    <p>A time of about 3 seconds to fall 45 meters seems reasonable. We only keep the positive root since negative time doesn't make physical sense in this context. The units work out correctly.</p>

    $$t = \frac{20.0}{9.8} = 2.04 \text{ s}$$
    
    <p><strong>Answer (b): Time to reach maximum height is 2.04 s</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Part (c): Total time in air</strong></p>
    <p><em>Step 1: Recognize the symmetry</em></p>
    <p>Due to the symmetry of projectile motion, the time going up equals the time coming down. Therefore:</p>
    $$t_{\text{total}} = 2 \times t_{\text{up}} = 2 \times 2.04 = 4.08 \text{ s}$$
    
    <p><em>Step 2: Check your answer</em></p>
    <p>Alternatively, we could solve using $\Delta y = 0$ (returns to starting height):</p>
    $$0 = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
    $$0 = 20.0t + \frac{1}{2}(-9.8)t^2$$
    $$0 = t(20.0 - 4.9t)$$
    <p>This gives $t = 0$ (starting time) or $t = 20.0/4.9 = 4.08$ s (landing time), confirming our answer.</p>

<!-- SUMMARY -->
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The four kinematic equations describe motion with constant acceleration: $v_f = v_i + at$, $\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$, $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$, and $\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$</li>
    <li>To solve kinematic problems, identify three known variables and select the equation containing those variables plus the unknown</li>
    <li>These equations ONLY work when acceleration is constant throughout the motion</li>
    <li>Free fall is the motion of objects under the influence of gravity alone, with acceleration $g = 9.8$ m/s²</li>
    <li>All objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass when air resistance is negligible—a discovery made by Galileo</li>
    <li>For free fall problems with up as positive, use $a = -9.8$ m/s²</li>
    <li>When an object is thrown upward, acceleration remains constant at $-g$ throughout the entire flight</li>
    <li>At the peak of upward motion, velocity is zero but acceleration is still $-g$</li>
    <li>For symmetric motion (same starting and ending heights), time up equals time down, and final speed equals initial speed</li>
    <li>The kinematic equations are powerful tools for analyzing real-world motion in situations ranging from car accidents to space missions</li>

<div class="answer-space-short"></div>

<!-- ANSWER KEY -->
<h2>Answer Key</h2>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Is the statement "at the top, velocity and acceleration are both zero" correct?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The statement is INCORRECT. At the very top of its flight, the ball does have zero velocity (it's momentarily at rest before changing direction). However, the acceleration is NOT zero—it's still $-9.8$ m/s² (downward). This constant downward acceleration is what causes the ball to stop rising and begin falling back down. If acceleration were zero at the top, the ball would remain suspended there! The acceleration due to gravity is constant throughout the entire flight: going up, at the peak, and coming down.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Two balls dropped from same height, different masses—which hits first?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Both balls hit the ground at exactly the same time (ignoring air resistance). This is because gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects regardless of their mass: $g = 9.8$ m/s². Although Ball A experiences twice the gravitational force of Ball B (since force = mass × acceleration), Ball A also has twice the inertia (resistance to acceleration). These effects exactly cancel, giving both balls the same acceleration and therefore the same fall time. This was Galileo's revolutionary discovery that contradicted 2,000 years of Aristotelian physics. The equation $\Delta y = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$ shows that fall time depends only on height and $g$, not on mass.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Why do you need three known variables to find a fourth?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The kinematic equations each relate four of the five variables ($v_i$, $v_f$, $a$, $t$, $\Delta x$). To solve for one unknown in an equation with four variables, you need to know the other three. If you only know two variables, you have two unknowns in the equation, which cannot be solved uniquely—there are infinitely many solutions. For example, if you only know $v_i = 10$ m/s and $a = 2$ m/s², you can't determine the final velocity without also knowing the time or displacement. With three known values, the equation becomes determinate with exactly one solution for the fourth variable.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Compare ball's speed leaving hand to speed returning to hand.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The ball's speed when it returns to your hand is exactly equal to its initial speed when it left (but in the opposite direction). We can prove this using symmetry: the time going up equals the time coming down, and the displacement for the complete trip is zero. Using $\Delta y = 0$ in $\Delta y = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$, we get $v_i t = -\frac{1}{2}at^2$. Then using $v_f = v_i + at$ at the return time gives $v_f = v_i - v_i = -v_i$. The negative sign indicates opposite direction. So if thrown upward at 15 m/s, it returns downward at -15 m/s (same speed, opposite direction). This symmetry is a consequence of constant acceleration throughout the motion.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Car accelerates from 15 m/s to 30 m/s over 180 m. Find acceleration.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Given: $v_i = 15$ m/s, $v_f = 30$ m/s, $\Delta x = 180$ m</p>
<p>Find: $a$</p>
<p>We have $v_i$, $v_f$, and $\Delta x$. Time is not given, so use:</p>
$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta x$$
<p>Solve for $a$:</p>
$$a = \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2\Delta x} = \frac{(30)^2 - (15)^2}{2(180)} = \frac{900 - 225}{360} = \frac{675}{360} = 1.875 \text{ m/s}^2$$
<p><strong>Answer: a = 1.9 m/s² (rounded to 2 sig figs)</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Stone dropped from cliff, takes 4.0 s to hit ground. Find cliff height.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Given: $v_i = 0$ m/s (dropped from rest), $t = 4.0$ s, $a = -9.8$ m/s² (taking down as negative)</p>
<p>Find: $\Delta y$ (height of cliff)</p>
<p>Use: $\Delta y = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$</p>
$$\Delta y = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(-9.8)(4.0)^2 = -4.9(16) = -78.4 \text{ m}$$
<p>The negative sign indicates downward displacement. The cliff height is the magnitude:</p>
<p><strong>Answer: The cliff is 78 m tall (or 78.4 m with more precision)</strong></p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Rocket accelerates from rest at 15 m/s² for 12 s. Find distance.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Given: $v_i = 0$ m/s (from rest), $a = 15$ m/s², $t = 12$ s</p>
<p>Find: $\Delta x$</p>
<p>Use: $\Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$</p>
$$\Delta x = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(15)(12)^2 = 7.5(144) = 1080 \text{ m}$$
<p>Or in scientific notation: $1.08 \times 10^3$ m or 1.08 km</p>
<p><strong>Answer: The rocket travels 1080 m (or 1.1 km)</strong></p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Ball thrown upward at 25 m/s. Find (a) velocity at t=3.0s, (b) position at t=3.0s, (c) max height.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part (a): Velocity after 3.0 seconds</strong></p>
<p>Given: $v_i = 25$ m/s, $a = -9.8$ m/s², $t = 3.0$ s</p>
<p>Use: $v_f = v_i + at$</p>
$$v_f = 25 + (-9.8)(3.0) = 25 - 29.4 = -4.4 \text{ m/s}$$
<p>The negative sign means the ball is moving downward at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Answer (a): v = -4.4 m/s (downward)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part (b): Position after 3.0 seconds</strong></p>
<p>Use: $\Delta y = v_i t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$</p>
$$\Delta y = (25)(3.0) + \frac{1}{2}(-9.8)(3.0)^2 = 75 - 4.9(9) = 75 - 44.1 = 30.9 \text{ m}$$
<p><strong>Answer (b): Position is 30.9 m (or 31 m) above starting point</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part (c): Maximum height</strong></p>
<p>At max height, $v_f = 0$. Use: $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a\Delta y$</p>
$$(0)^2 = (25)^2 + 2(-9.8)\Delta y$$
$$0 = 625 - 19.6\Delta y$$
$$\Delta y = \frac{625}{19.6} = 31.9 \text{ m}$$
<p><strong>Answer (c): Maximum height is 31.9 m (or 32 m with 2 sig figs)</strong></p>
