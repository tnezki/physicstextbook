        <p>Science is more than just facts and formulas—it's a way of thinking and investigating the world. The scientific method is a systematic process that scientists use to ask questions, test ideas, and discover new knowledge. In this section, you'll learn how to think like a scientist and apply this powerful method to solve problems.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>Imagine you walk into your kitchen one morning and flip the light switch, but the light doesn't turn on. What do you do? You probably start asking questions: Is the bulb burned out? Is there a power outage? Did a circuit breaker trip? You might check the bulb, look out the window to see if neighbors have power, or check the breaker box. Without realizing it, you're using the scientific method to solve a problem!</p>
        
        <p>The <span class="vocab-term">scientific method</span> is a systematic approach to investigating questions and solving problems. It's the foundation of all scientific inquiry, from simple classroom experiments to groundbreaking discoveries that change our understanding of the universe. While scientists in different fields may apply the method in slightly different ways, the core process remains the same.</p>
        
        <div class="real-world-box">
            <h3>Real-World Connection: The Scientific Method in Everyday Life</h3>
            <p>You use the scientific method more often than you might think. When your car won't start, you investigate possible causes. When you're trying to improve your free throw percentage in basketball, you experiment with different techniques. When you follow a recipe but the cookies don't turn out right, you analyze what went wrong and adjust for next time. The scientific method is a practical tool for solving all kinds of problems.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- ============== MAIN CONTENT ============== -->
        <h1>The Steps of the Scientific Method</h1>
        
        <p>The scientific method consists of several key steps that work together as a cycle. Scientists often repeat these steps multiple times, refining their understanding with each iteration.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Make Observations</h3>
        <p>Science begins with careful <span class="vocab-term">observation</span>—using your senses to gather information about the world. Observations can be <span class="vocab-term">qualitative</span> (descriptive, such as "the liquid is blue" or "the sound is loud") or <span class="vocab-term">quantitative</span> (numerical, such as "the temperature is 25°C" or "the mass is 15.3 grams").</p>
        
        <p>Good observations are objective (based on facts, not opinions), accurate (careful and precise), and complete (including all relevant details). Scientists often use instruments to make observations that go beyond what our senses can detect—telescopes to see distant galaxies, microscopes to see tiny cells, or thermometers to measure temperature precisely.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Ask Questions</h3>
        <p>Observations naturally lead to questions. A <span class="vocab-term">scientific question</span> is one that can be answered through investigation and experimentation. Good scientific questions are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Testable:</strong> Can be investigated through experiments or observations</li>
            <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Focused on a particular phenomenon</li>
            <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Involves quantities that can be measured or observed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For example, "Why is the sky blue?" is a good scientific question. "Which color is the prettiest?" is not a scientific question because "prettiest" is a matter of opinion, not something that can be objectively measured.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Form a Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>A <span class="vocab-term">hypothesis</span> is a testable prediction or proposed explanation for an observation. It's an educated guess based on prior knowledge and observations. A good hypothesis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answers the scientific question</li>
            <li>Can be tested through experiments</li>
            <li>Can be supported or refuted by evidence</li>
            <li>Often written in "If...then..." format</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Example hypothesis: "If I increase the voltage in a circuit, then the bulb will get brighter because more electrical energy will be converted to light energy."</p>
        
        <div class="vocab-box">
            <p><span class="vocab-term">Hypothesis:</span> A testable prediction or proposed explanation for an observation. It can be proven wrong (falsifiable).</p>
            <p><span class="vocab-term">Theory:</span> A well-tested explanation for a wide range of observations, supported by extensive evidence from many experiments. Examples: Theory of Evolution, Atomic Theory, Theory of Relativity.</p>
            <p><span class="vocab-term">Scientific Law:</span> A statement that describes a consistent pattern in nature, often expressed mathematically. Laws describe <em>what</em> happens; theories explain <em>why</em>. Examples: Newton's Laws of Motion, Law of Conservation of Energy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Important: Hypothesis vs. Theory</h3>
            <p>In everyday language, people often say "it's just a theory" to mean a guess or hunch. But in science, a theory is much more than a guess—it's a comprehensive explanation supported by vast amounts of evidence. A hypothesis is a starting point; a theory is a destination reached after years or decades of testing and validation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Design and Conduct an Experiment</h3>
        <p>An <span class="vocab-term">experiment</span> is a controlled procedure designed to test a hypothesis. In a well-designed experiment, you:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Identify Variables:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="vocab-term">Independent variable:</span> The variable you deliberately change or manipulate (also called the manipulated variable)</li>
            <li><span class="vocab-term">Dependent variable:</span> The variable you observe or measure that responds to changes in the independent variable (also called the responding variable)</li>
            <li><span class="vocab-term">Controlled variables:</span> All other variables that you keep constant so they don't affect the results (also called constants)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Include Controls:</strong> A <span class="vocab-term">control group</span> is a standard for comparison—it doesn't receive the experimental treatment. This helps you determine whether your independent variable is really causing the observed effect.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Collect Data:</strong> Carefully record all observations and measurements. Data should be organized in tables, charts, or graphs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Repeat Trials:</strong> Conduct multiple trials of your experiment to check for consistency and increase reliability.</p>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h3>Experiment Design Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Does fertilizer help plants grow taller?</p>
            <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> If I add fertilizer to soil, then plants will grow taller because they will have more nutrients.</p>
            <p><strong>Independent Variable:</strong> Presence/absence of fertilizer (what you change)</p>
            <p><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> Plant height (what you measure)</p>
            <p><strong>Controlled Variables:</strong> Type of plant, amount of water, amount of sunlight, type of soil, pot size, temperature (everything you keep the same)</p>
            <p><strong>Control Group:</strong> Plants grown without fertilizer</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Analyze Data</h3>
        <p>After collecting data, scientists <span class="vocab-term">analyze</span> it to look for patterns, trends, and relationships. This often involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating graphs to visualize data</li>
            <li>Calculating averages, percentages, or other statistics</li>
            <li>Looking for correlations between variables</li>
            <li>Identifying sources of error or uncertainty</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 6: Draw Conclusions</h3>
        <p>Based on your data analysis, you draw a <span class="vocab-term">conclusion</span> about whether your hypothesis was supported or refuted. A good conclusion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>States whether the hypothesis was supported by the data</li>
            <li>Explains the evidence that supports your conclusion</li>
            <li>Acknowledges limitations or sources of error</li>
            <li>Suggests questions for further investigation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Remember: A hypothesis that is not supported is NOT a failure! Scientists learn just as much (sometimes more) from experiments that refute a hypothesis as from those that support it.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 7: Communicate Results</h3>
        <p>Scientists share their findings with others through scientific papers, presentations, and conferences. <span class="vocab-term">Peer review</span>—having other scientists evaluate your work—is a crucial part of the scientific process. It helps catch errors, biases, or flawed reasoning.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 8: Repeat and Refine</h3>
        <p>Science is an ongoing process. Other scientists repeat experiments to verify results. New questions emerge from conclusions. Hypotheses are refined and tested again. This cycle of investigation leads to deeper understanding over time.</p>
        
        <div class="real-world-box">
            <h3>Historical Note: Galileo and the Scientific Method</h3>
            <p>Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often called the "father of modern science" because he emphasized experimentation and mathematical analysis. Before Galileo, many people accepted Aristotle's claim that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. Galileo questioned this, hypothesized that all objects fall at the same rate (in the absence of air resistance), and tested it through careful experiments. His insistence on testing ideas through experiments helped establish the scientific method as we know it today.</p>

        <!-- ============== CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD SCIENCE ============== -->
        <h1>Characteristics of Good Science</h1>
        
        <p>What makes science different from other ways of understanding the world? Good science has several important characteristics:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Empirical</h3>
        <p>Science is based on <span class="vocab-term">empirical evidence</span>—information gained through observation and experimentation, not just logical reasoning or personal beliefs.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Testable and Falsifiable</h3>
        <p>Scientific hypotheses must be <span class="vocab-term">testable</span> (can be investigated through experiments) and <span class="vocab-term">falsifiable</span> (it must be possible to prove them wrong). If a claim cannot be tested or disproven, it's not scientific.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Repeatable and Reproducible</h3>
        <p>Other scientists should be able to repeat your experiment and get similar results. <span class="vocab-term">Reproducibility</span> is essential for validating scientific findings.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Objective</h3>
        <p>Scientists strive for <span class="vocab-term">objectivity</span>—basing conclusions on evidence rather than personal biases or preferences. While complete objectivity is impossible (we all have biases), scientists work to minimize bias through careful experimental design and peer review.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Self-Correcting</h3>
        <p>When new evidence contradicts old ideas, science changes. This self-correcting nature means our scientific understanding improves over time as we gather more evidence.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Limitations of Science</h3>
            <p>While science is a powerful tool, it has limitations. Science can only answer questions about the natural, physical world. It cannot answer questions about values, ethics, morality, or aesthetics (beauty). Questions like "Should we build this technology?" or "What is the meaning of life?" are important, but they're not scientific questions. Science can inform these discussions by providing facts, but cannot answer them alone.</p>

        <!-- ============== ANSWER KEY ============== -->
        <h1>Answer Key</h1>
        
        <p><strong>1.</strong> The steps of the scientific method are: (1) <strong>Observe</strong> - Use your senses to gather information about the world. (2) <strong>Ask Questions</strong> - Identify what you want to understand or investigate. (3) <strong>Form a Hypothesis</strong> - Make a testable prediction. (4) <strong>Conduct an Experiment</strong> - Design and carry out a test of your hypothesis. (5) <strong>Analyze Data</strong> - Look for patterns and relationships in your results. (6) <strong>Draw Conclusions</strong> - Determine whether your hypothesis was supported. (7) <strong>Communicate Results</strong> - Share your findings with others. (8) <strong>Repeat</strong> - Test again or investigate new questions that arise.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.</strong> A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a testable prediction about a specific situation (example: "If I add salt to water, then it will freeze at a lower temperature"). A <strong>theory</strong> is a comprehensive, well-tested explanation for a wide range of observations, supported by lots of evidence (example: Atomic Theory, which explains that all matter is made of atoms). A <strong>scientific law</strong> is a statement that describes a pattern in nature, often mathematical (example: Newton's Second Law, $F = ma$). Hypotheses can be proven wrong quickly; theories are supported by years of evidence; laws describe what happens but don't always explain why.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Independent variable:</strong> Type of soil (this is what the student changes). <strong>Dependent variable:</strong> Growth rate or height of bean plants (this is what the student measures). <strong>Controlled variables:</strong> Type of bean seeds, amount of water, amount of sunlight, temperature, pot size, and time allowed for growth (these must all be kept the same for all plants).</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Repeatability is important because it allows other scientists to verify results and check for errors or biases. If an experiment can be repeated by different people in different locations and produces consistent results, we can have more confidence that the findings are reliable and not due to chance, mistakes, or fraud. Repeatability is one of the foundations of the scientific process—it ensures that scientific knowledge is based on consistent, verifiable evidence rather than one person's isolated claim.</p>

        <p><strong>Part (c): Total surface area</strong></p>
        <p>Calculate area of each pair of faces:</p>
        <p>Top/bottom: $2 \times lw = 2 \times 4000 = 8000$ cm²</p>
        <p>Front/back: $2 \times lh = 2 \times (80)(60) = 2 \times 4800 = 9600$ cm²</p>
        <p>Left/right sides: $2 \times wh = 2 \times (50)(60) = 2 \times 3000 = 6000$ cm²</p>
        <p><strong>Total:</strong> $SA = 8000 + 9600 + 6000 = 23{,}600$ cm²</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The total surface area is <strong>23,600 cm²</strong> (or 2.36 m²).</p>
