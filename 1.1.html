        <p>Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces that govern our universe. From the tiniest particles to the largest galaxies, physics helps us understand how everything works. In this section, we'll explore what physics is, what it studies, and how it connects to other sciences.</p>

        <!-- ============== INTRODUCTION ============== -->
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>Have you ever wondered why the sky is blue? Why does a ball thrown in the air eventually fall back down? How do cell phones communicate with towers miles away? What makes a roller coaster thrilling? All of these questions—and countless others—are answered by physics.</p>
        
        <p><span class="vocab-term">Physics</span> is the branch of science that studies matter, energy, and the interactions between them. The word "physics" comes from the Greek word "physikos," meaning "natural." Physics seeks to understand the natural world by discovering the fundamental laws that govern how everything works, from the smallest particles to the entire universe.</p>
        
        <div class="real-world-box">
            <h3>Real-World Connection: Physics in Your Daily Life</h3>
            <p>You experience physics every moment of every day. When you turn on a light, walk down stairs, listen to music, or check your phone, you're experiencing the laws of physics in action. Understanding physics helps you make sense of the world around you and appreciate the technology that shapes modern life.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Physics is sometimes called the "fundamental science" because it provides the foundation for all other sciences. Chemistry studies how atoms and molecules interact—but atoms themselves are explained by physics. Biology studies living things—but the processes of life depend on chemical reactions, which depend on physics. Earth science studies our planet—but weather, earthquakes, and climate all follow physical laws.</p>
        
        <!-- ============== MAIN CONTENT ============== -->
        <h1>What Does Physics Study?</h1>
        
        <p>Physics studies a huge range of phenomena, from the incredibly small to the unimaginably large. Here are the main topics that physics investigates:</p>
        
        <h3>Matter and Energy</h3>
        <p>At its core, physics studies <span class="vocab-term">matter</span>—the "stuff" that makes up everything in the universe—and <span class="vocab-term">energy</span>—the ability to do work or cause change. These two concepts are fundamental to all of physics. In fact, Einstein's famous equation $E = mc^2$ shows that matter and energy are actually two forms of the same thing!</p>
        
        <div class="vocab-box">
            <p><span class="vocab-term">Matter:</span> Anything that has mass and takes up space. Examples include air, water, rocks, people, and stars.</p>
            <p><span class="vocab-term">Energy:</span> The ability to do work or cause a change. Energy exists in many forms including motion (kinetic), position (potential), heat (thermal), light (electromagnetic), and more.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Forces and Motion</h3>
        <p>Physics explains why and how things move. <span class="vocab-term">Force</span> is a push or pull on an object, and <span class="vocab-term">motion</span> describes how an object's position changes over time. When you kick a soccer ball, throw a baseball, or ride a bike, you're experiencing forces and motion. Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, developed over 300 years ago, still accurately describe the motion of everything from cars to planets.</p>
        
        <h3>Interactions and Fields</h3>
        <p>Physics studies how objects influence each other, even from a distance. Earth pulls on the Moon through the force of gravity, keeping it in orbit. Magnets attract or repel each other through magnetic fields. These <span class="vocab-term">interactions</span> happen through <span class="vocab-term">fields</span>—regions of space where forces can be exerted. The four fundamental forces in nature are gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.</p>
        
        <!-- ============== BRANCHES OF PHYSICS ============== -->
        <h1>The Major Branches of Physics</h1>
        
        <p>Physics is a vast field, so scientists divide it into specialized branches. Each branch focuses on a particular aspect of the physical world:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Mechanics</h3>
        <p><span class="vocab-term">Mechanics</span> is the study of motion and forces. This is often the first topic students learn in physics because it describes everyday experiences like throwing a ball, driving a car, or riding a roller coaster. Mechanics includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Classical mechanics:</strong> Motion of ordinary objects at everyday speeds</li>
            <li><strong>Fluid mechanics:</strong> Behavior of liquids and gases</li>
            <li><strong>Statics:</strong> Objects at rest and in balance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Thermodynamics</h3>
        <p><span class="vocab-term">Thermodynamics</span> studies heat, temperature, and energy transfer. It explains why ice melts, how engines work, and why you feel cold when you step out of a pool. Thermodynamics is crucial for understanding everything from weather patterns to power plants.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Waves and Optics</h3>
        <p>This branch studies how energy travels through waves and how light behaves. <span class="vocab-term">Waves</span> include sound waves, water waves, and light waves. <span class="vocab-term">Optics</span> specifically focuses on light and vision, explaining how mirrors, lenses, cameras, and your eyes work.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Electricity and Magnetism</h3>
        <p>This branch, also called <span class="vocab-term">electromagnetism</span>, studies electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic fields. It explains how batteries work, why lightning strikes, and how electric motors operate. Modern technology—from computers to power grids—depends entirely on our understanding of electricity and magnetism.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Modern Physics</h3>
        <p><span class="vocab-term">Modern physics</span> includes discoveries made in the 20th and 21st centuries. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quantum mechanics:</strong> Behavior of atoms and subatomic particles</li>
            <li><strong>Relativity:</strong> Motion at speeds close to the speed of light, and the nature of space and time</li>
            <li><strong>Nuclear physics:</strong> The nucleus of atoms and nuclear reactions</li>
            <li><strong>Particle physics:</strong> The most fundamental building blocks of matter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6. Astronomy and Astrophysics</h3>
        <p><span class="vocab-term">Astrophysics</span> applies physics to understand stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe as a whole. It explains how stars produce energy, why planets orbit, and what happens inside black holes.</p>
        
        <div class="real-world-box">
            <h3>Historical Note: The Birth of Modern Physics</h3>
            <p>For centuries, physics meant the study of motion and forces (mechanics). This changed dramatically around 1900 with revolutionary discoveries. Max Planck discovered that energy comes in tiny packets called "quanta" (1900). Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity (1905) and explained the photoelectric effect, helping establish quantum mechanics. Ernest Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus (1911). These breakthroughs created "modern physics" and revolutionized our understanding of reality itself.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- ============== PHYSICS AND OTHER SCIENCES ============== -->
        <h1>How Physics Connects to Other Sciences</h1>
        
        <p>Physics is interconnected with all other sciences. Understanding these connections shows why physics is called the "fundamental science."</p>
        
        <h3>Physics and Chemistry</h3>
        <p>Chemistry studies how atoms bond together and how molecules interact. But atoms themselves—their structure and behavior—are explained by physics (quantum mechanics). Chemical reactions involve breaking and forming bonds, which involves electrical forces between electrons and nuclei. Physical chemistry uses physics principles to explain chemical phenomena.</p>
        
        <h3>Physics and Biology</h3>
        <p>Biology studies living organisms, but life depends on physical processes. Your heart pumps blood using pressure (fluid mechanics). Your nervous system transmits signals using electricity (electromagnetism). Your eyes detect light (optics). Your ears hear sound (waves).

        <!-- ============== ANSWER KEY ============== -->
        <h1>Answer Key</h1>
        
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Physics is the study of how the natural world works. The two main concepts that physics studies are matter (the stuff that makes up everything) and energy (the ability to do work or cause change). Physics investigates how matter and energy interact with each other.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Physics is called the "fundamental science" because it explains the basic laws that govern all natural phenomena. Other sciences build on physics. For example, chemistry studies how atoms and molecules interact, but the structure and behavior of atoms themselves are explained by physics (quantum mechanics). Biology studies living organisms, but life processes depend on chemical reactions (which depend on physics) and physical phenomena like electrical signals in nerves and optical processes in vision.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Answers will vary, but should include three from: (1) <strong>Mechanics</strong> studies motion and forces, such as why a ball thrown upward eventually falls back down. (2) <strong>Thermodynamics</strong> studies heat and temperature, such as why ice melts when left at room temperature. (3) <strong>Waves and Optics</strong> studies how energy travels through waves, such as how sound reaches your ears or how light allows you to see. (4) <strong>Electromagnetism</strong> studies electricity and magnetism, such as how batteries provide power or how magnets attract metal. (5) <strong>Modern Physics</strong> includes quantum mechanics and relativity, studying atoms and very fast-moving objects. (6) <strong>Astrophysics</strong> applies physics to space, studying stars, planets, and galaxies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Answers will vary. Examples might include: (1) Turning on a light bulb demonstrates electricity and magnetism (electromagnetism).
